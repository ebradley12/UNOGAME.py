UNO GAME:


The object of Uno is to be the first player to get rid of all cards. 

The Set-up:

There are 108 cards in a Uno deck. There are four suits, Red, Green, Yellow and Blue, each consisting of one 0 card, two 1 cards, two 2s, 3s, 4s, 5s, 6s, 7s, 8s and 9s; two Draw Two cards; two Skip cards; and two Reverse cards. In addition there are four Wild cards and four Wild Draw Four cards.
The game begins with each player being dealt seven cards. The first player then selects a card from his/her hand by matching either colour or number of the top card of the discarded pile, or if an action card is played, take the necessary action. The player's card is then placed on top of the discard pile for the next player to match. 
If at any time a player cannot play any card, 1 card must be drawn from the uno stock pile and play moves to the next player.
Skip - If a Skip card is played, the next player's loses their turn. 

Reverse - If a Reverse card is played, the player who played prior to the current player has the opportunity to play again and the direction of play is reversed.
Draw Two - The next player must draw two cards from the stock and forfeit her turn. Play then continues with the next player according to the direction of play.
Wild cards - These cards may be played on any colour or type of card. The player playing a Wild card may change the colour of play to any colour at all. 
Wild Draw Four cards - As well as allowing the player to change the colour, these cards also force the next player to draw 4 cards from the stockpile and forfeit their turn.
When a player has played their second to last card, the player has "uno". This warns the opposing players that the player may be able to go out on her next turn.
If this player then plays their last card on their next go, the game is over and this player has won.
